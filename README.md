# Gesture Recognition Using Arduino Nano and TensorFlow Lite

This project demonstrates how to implement **real-time gesture recognition** using an **Arduino Nano** and **TensorFlow Lite**. The system captures motion data from an **MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope**, processes it using a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model, and classifies gestures in real-time. This is a great example of running machine learning on microcontrollers!

## Introduction
Gesture recognition is a powerful tool for human-computer interaction. This project leverages **TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers** to run a machine learning model on an **Arduino Nano**, enabling real-time gesture recognition. The system uses an **MPU6050 sensor** to capture motion data, which is then fed into a TensorFlow Lite model for classification.

This project is ideal for:
- Learning how to deploy machine learning models on microcontrollers.
- Building gesture-controlled applications.
- Exploring TinyML (Tiny Machine Learning).

   cd Gesture-Recognition-Using-Arduino-Nano-and-TensorFlow-Lite
   ```

2. **Install Arduino IDE:**
   - Download and install the Arduino IDE from the [official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

3. **Install Required Arduino Libraries:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Go to `Sketch` -> `Include Library` -> `Manage Libraries`.
   - Search for and install the following libraries:
     - `TensorFlowLite`
     - `Wire`

## Usage
### Step 1: Upload the Sketch to Arduino Nano
- Open the `Gesture_Recognition.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
- Connect your Arduino Nano to your computer.
- Select the correct board and port from the `Tools` menu.
- Click the `Upload` button to upload the sketch to the Arduino Nano.

### Step 2: Collect Data
- Use the provided Python script (`collect_data.py`) to collect gesture data from the MPU6050 sensor.
- Save the collected data in a CSV file for training.

### Step 3: Run Gesture Recognition
- Once the sketch is uploaded, the Arduino Nano will start capturing data from the MPU6050 sensor.
- The TensorFlow Lite model will classify the gestures in real-time and output the results to the Serial Monitor.

## Training the Model
1. **Prepare the Dataset:**
   - Use the collected data to train a TensorFlow model.
   - The dataset should include accelerometer and gyroscope data for each gesture you want to recognize.

2. **Train the Model:**
   - Use the provided Python script (`train_model.py`) to train the model.
   - The script will save the trained model in TensorFlow Lite format.

3. **Convert the Model:**
   - Convert the trained model to a TensorFlow Lite model using the TensorFlow Lite Converter.
   - Save the model as a `.tflite` file.

---

## Deploying the Model to Arduino
1. **Include the Model in the Sketch:**
   - Convert the `.tflite` model to a C array using the `xxd` command or a similar tool.
   - Include the model array in the Arduino sketch.

2. **Upload the Sketch:**
   - Upload the updated sketch to the Arduino Nano.
   - The Arduino will now use the new model for gesture recognition.
